# Core dependencies for GoPro highlight extraction
# Note: This script also requires ffmpeg and ffprobe to be installed on your system

# TransNetV2 scene detection dependencies (optional but recommended)
# These are required for the neural network-based scene detection
torch>=1.9.0  # PyTorch for running TransNetV2 neural network (better Python 3.13+ support)
opencv-python>=4.5.0        # OpenCV for video processing and frame extraction
numpy>=1.21.0               # NumPy for array operations

# Standard library modules used (no installation required):
# - asyncio (async/await support)
# - argparse (command-line argument parsing)
# - logging (logging functionality)
# - os (operating system interface)
# - re (regular expressions)
# - struct (binary data parsing for MP4 boxes)
# - subprocess (running external commands like ffmpeg)
# - sys (system-specific parameters)
# - tempfile (temporary file/directory creation)
# - pathlib (modern path handling)
# - typing (type hints)
# - json (JSON handling - unused but imported)
# - dataclasses (data class decorator)
# - concurrent.futures (thread pool executor)
# - time (time-related functions)
# - urllib.request (downloading TransNetV2 model files)
# - urllib.error (URL error handling)

# External system dependencies (must be installed separately):
# - ffmpeg (video processing)
# - ffprobe (video metadata extraction)
#
# On macOS: brew install ffmpeg
# On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
# On Windows: Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

# Development dependencies for testing
